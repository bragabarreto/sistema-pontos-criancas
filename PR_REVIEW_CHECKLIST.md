| Responsive design | ‚úÖ Done | Grid: 1 col mobile, 4 cols desktop |
| Backward compatible | ‚úÖ Done | No breaking changes |

## ‚úÖ Code Quality Checks

### Logic Correctness
- [x] Filters activities from today correctly (using midnight as cutoff)
- [x] Separates positive and negative points
- [x] Includes multipliers in calculations
- [x] Handles edge cases (empty arrays, no activities today)
- [x] Uses safe array operations (filter, reduce)

### UI/UX
- [x] 4 banners with clear labels
- [x] Color coding (Blue, Green, Red, Purple)
- [x] Sign indicators ("+" for positive, "-" for negative)
- [x] Responsive grid layout
- [x] Consistent styling with existing design

### Code Style
- [x] Follows existing code patterns
- [x] Uses TypeScript properly
- [x] No magic numbers or strings
- [x] Clear variable names
- [x] Comments where helpful

## ‚úÖ Testing

### Build & Lint
```bash
‚úÖ npm run build - PASSED
‚úÖ npm run lint - PASSED (no new warnings)
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- [x] Empty activities array
- [x] No activities today
- [x] Only positive activities
- [x] Only negative activities
- [x] Mixed positive and negative activities
- [x] Activities with multipliers

### Manual Testing (to be done by reviewer)
- [ ] Create some activities with positive points
- [ ] Create some activities with negative points
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows correct calculations
- [ ] Check on mobile device
- [ ] Check on desktop
- [ ] Delete an activity and verify recalculation

## ‚úÖ Documentation

### Files Added

- [x] DASHBOARD_FIX_EXPLANATION.md - Technical details
- [x] DASHBOARD_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md - Before/after comparison
- [x] DASHBOARD_UI_MOCKUP.md - Visual mockup

### Content Quality
- [x] Clear explanation of problem
- [x] Detailed solution description
- [x] Code examples with comments
- [x] Visual diagrams
- [x] Example calculations
- [x] Benefits and impact

5. Maintains existing design patterns
6. Type-safe implementation
7. Responsive design preserved

### Potential Concerns (None identified)
- No concerns identified - implementation is straightforward and safe

### Questions for Reviewer
1. Should we add a tooltip explaining the calculation formula?
2. Should we show the "Total de Pontos" (cumulative total) anywhere?
3. Do we want to add date range filtering in the future?

## üéâ Summary

This PR successfully fixes the Dashboard points calculation issue by:
- Adding daily activity filtering
- Separating positive and negative points calculation
- Updating UI to show 4 clear banners
- Following the exact formula specified in requirements
- Maintaining code quality and design consistency

# Feature: Expense Tracking System

## Overview

This feature adds comprehensive expense tracking for children, allowing parents to register expenses (gastos) that are automatically deducted from the child's point balance. Expenses are fully integrated into the dashboard, reports, and balance calculations.

## User Stories

1. **As a parent, I want to register expenses for my child** so that their spending is tracked and deducted from their balance.
2. **As a parent, I want to see today's total expenses on the dashboard** so I can monitor daily spending.
3. **As a parent, I want to view expense history** so I can review past spending.
4. **As a parent, I want expenses to be included in reports** so I can see spending patterns over time.

## Database Schema

### expenses table
```sql
CREATE TABLE expenses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  child_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES children(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Color Scheme

The expense feature uses a consistent orange color theme to distinguish it from points:
- **Dashboard Card**: Orange gradient (from-orange-500 to-orange-600)
- **Expense Values**: Orange text (text-orange-600)
- **Add Button**: Orange background (bg-orange-600)
- **Report Card**: Light orange background (bg-orange-100)

This creates clear visual separation:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green = Positive Points
- ðŸ”´ Red = Negative Points
- ðŸŸ  Orange = Expenses
- ðŸŸ£ Purple = Final Balance
- ðŸ”µ Blue = Initial Balance

## Usage Example

   - Go to Dashboard
   - Click "Adicionar Gasto"
   - Fill in:
     - Description: "Sorvete"
     - Amount: 10

   - Click "Salvar"

2. **View in Dashboard**:

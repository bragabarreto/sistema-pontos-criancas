# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
Vercel deployment was failing with an error when trying to deploy the Next.js application.

## Root Cause
The `next.config.js` file contained the configuration `output: 'standalone'`, which is incompatible with Vercel's deployment system.

### What is `output: 'standalone'`?
The `standalone` output mode is a Next.js feature designed for:
- Docker containerized deployments
- Self-hosted environments
- Scenarios where you want to minimize dependencies by creating a standalone folder with only necessary files

### Why doesn't it work with Vercel?
Vercel has its own optimized build and deployment system specifically designed for Next.js applications. The `standalone` output mode:
- Changes the build output structure in ways that conflict with Vercel's expectations
- Is redundant since Vercel already optimizes Next.js deployments
- Can cause deployment failures and errors

## Solution
Removed the `output: 'standalone'` line from `next.config.js`.

### Before:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
}
```

### After:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  // Removed 'output: standalone' as it's for Docker/self-hosting
  // Vercel has its own optimized deployment system
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Local build completes successfully
- ✅ All routes generate correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

## Recommendation
For Vercel deployments, let Vercel handle the build optimization. Only use `output: 'standalone'` if you're deploying to:
- Docker containers
- Self-hosted servers
- Non-Vercel hosting platforms
